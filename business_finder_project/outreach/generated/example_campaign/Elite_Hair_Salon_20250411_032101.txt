Subject: Boost Your Online Presence for Elite Hair Salon

Dear Mrs. Williams,

I hope this email finds you well. I recently discovered Elite Hair Salon while researching outstanding hairdresser in Birmingham, UK, and I was impressed by your reputation.

However, I noticed that Elite Hair Salon doesn't currently have a website, which means you might be missing out on potential customers who are searching online for services like yours.

As a web developer specializing in creating effective websites for hairdresser businesses, I'd love to help you establish a strong online presence. A professional website can:

1. Make your business discoverable to new customers searching online
2. Showcase your services and unique selling points
3. Allow customers to find your location, hours, and contact information 24/7
4. Showcase your portfolio of styles and transformations

I've helped several hairdresser businesses in Birmingham, UK increase their customer base through effective websites. I'd be happy to discuss how we could create a website tailored specifically to your needs.

Would you be available for a quick 15-minute call to discuss how a website could benefit Elite Hair Salon? You can book a time that works for you here: [Your Calendly Link]

Looking forward to potentially working together,
