# Research Findings: Methods to Find Local Businesses Without Websites

## Overview
This document summarizes research on methods to identify local businesses in London and England that don't have websites, particularly those without Google Maps Business links. These findings will inform the development of our business finder tool.

## Methods for Finding Businesses Without Websites

### 1. Google Maps Method
Google Maps provides a straightforward way to identify businesses without websites:

1. **Search for Business Categories**: Search for specific business types in target locations (e.g., "restaurants in London," "plumbers in Manchester")
2. **Examine Listings**: In the results sidebar, businesses with websites will display a clickable link, while those without websites will lack this feature
3. **Zoom and Adjust Search Area**: Focus on specific neighborhoods or areas to find more localized results
4. **Verify Online Presence**: Some businesses might not have dedicated websites but could be using social media pages instead
5. **Document Potential Leads**: Create a spreadsheet with business details (name, phone, address, email if available)

### 2. Manual Community Methods
These traditional approaches can still be effective:

1. **Local Networking**: Ask neighbors, friends, or family about local businesses without websites
2. **Business Events**: Attend local business events and chambers of commerce meetings
3. **Walk-Through Surveys**: Physically visit business districts and speak with owners
4. **Social Media Groups**: Search local community groups on Facebook for businesses that list social media but no website
5. **Traditional Directories**: Check Yellow Pages, local newspapers, and city directories

2. **Cost concerns**: Some businesses perceive website development as too expensive
3. **Time constraints**: Business owners may be too busy running their operations
4. **Reliance on traditional methods**: Some businesses still rely on word-of-mouth and traditional advertising

## Outreach Strategies

2. **Social Media Messaging**: Friendly, value-driven messages on platforms businesses already use
3. **Free Consultations**: Offer brief consultations to demonstrate value
